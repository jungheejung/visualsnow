# visualsnow

This repository hosts code and images for fMRI data collection with Visual Snow patients. 
The MRI protocol involves 1) T1-weighted, 2) T2-weighted, and 3) four EPI resting-state scans. 
The protocol sequence can be found here [TODO]()

The functional resting-state scan show no other stimulus other than a fixation cross for the whole duration of 8 min. We provide instructions prior to the scan whether to a) open or b) close eyes. The sequence of eyes open and closed are counterbalanced across participants.
